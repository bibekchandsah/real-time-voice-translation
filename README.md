### 4. During Calls

- Keep the application window open and visible
- The "Always on Top" feature ensures it stays visible
- Audio level bar shows current input levels
- Translations appear with timestamps

## Configuration

The application creates a `translator_config.json` file with these settings:

- `openai_api_key`: Your OpenAI API key
- `source_language`: Source language detection (auto-detect)
- `target_language`: Target language for translation
- `audio_threshold`: Minimum audio level to process (reduces noise)
- `translation_model`: OpenAI model to use
- `selected_audio_model`: Currently selected audio processing model

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues

1. **No audio detected**: Check microphone permissions and ensure your microphone is working
2. **Poor quality**: Adjust the `audio_threshold` in config file
3. **Latency**: The app processes audio every 3 seconds for better accuracy

### API Issues

1. **Invalid API key**: Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
2. **Rate limits**: OpenAI has usage limits - check your account
3. **Model access**: Ensure you have access to GPT-4o-audio-preview

### Performance

- The app keeps only the last 50 translations to prevent memory issues
- Audio processing runs in background threads for smooth performance
- GUI updates are optimized for real-time display

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Clear Audio**: Ensure good microphone quality and minimal background noise
2. **Stable Internet**: Translation requires internet connection to OpenAI
3. **Proper Positioning**: Keep the app window visible but not blocking your call interface
4. **Language Detection**: The app auto-detects source language, works best with clear speech
5. **Model Selection**: Use Whisper-1 for cost-effective transcription, GPT-4o Audio for best quality
6. **5-Second Intervals**: The app processes audio every 5 seconds for complete sentences

## Supported Languages

The app can translate FROM any language TO:
- English (default)
- Nepali
- Hindi
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Chinese
- Japanese

You can modify the target language list in the code to add more languages.
